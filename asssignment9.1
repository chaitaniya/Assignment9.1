Q.1.Why MapReduce program is needed in Pig Programming?
Ans.
a)Basically,one can use an analogy that as high level languarge are converted to assembly level language similarly pig latin script uses mapreduce.
Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, 
coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs. The salient property of Pig programs is that their structure is amenable to
substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them to handle very large data sets.


Q.2What are advantages of pig over MapReduce?
a)Decrease in development time. This is the biggest advantage especially considering vanilla map-reduce jobs' complexity, time-spent
and maintenance of the programs.
b)Learning curve is not steep, anyone who does not know how to write vanilla map-reduce or SQL for that matter could pick up 
and can write map-reduce jobs;not easy to master, though.
c)Procedural, not declarative unlike SQL, so easier to follow the commands and provides better expressiveness in the transformation of data every step. 
Comparing to vanilla map-reduce, it is much more like an english language. It is concise and unlike Java but more like Python.
d)Enjoys everything that Hadoop offers, parallelization, fault-tolerancy with many relational database features.
e)It is quite effective for unstructured and messy large datasets. Actually, Pig is one of the best tool to make the large unstructured data to structured.

Q.3. What is pig engine and what is its importance?
a)Apache Pig has a component known as Pig Engine that accepts the Pig Latin scripts as input and converts those scripts into MapReduce jobs.
b)It is highly beneficial for data analysts as it reduces the overall size of the program.

Q.4.What are the modes of Pig execution?
Ans)
a)Local Mode:
In this mode, all the files are installed and run from your local host and local file system. There is no need of Hadoop or HDFS. 
This mode is generally used for testing purpose.

b)MapReduce Mode
MapReduce mode is where we load or process the data that exists in the Hadoop File System (HDFS) using Apache Pig. 
In this mode, whenever we execute the Pig Latin statements to process the data, a MapReduce job is invoked in the back-end to 
perform a particular operation on the data that exists in the HDFS.


Q.5.What is grunt shell in Pig?
Ans)
After invoking the Grunt shell one can run Pig scripts in the shell. In addition to that, there are certain useful shell and utility commands
provided by the Grunt shell.
we can invoke any shell commands using sh and fs.

Q.6.What are the features of Pig Latin language?
Ans)
a)It is a scripting language.
b)sing Pig Latin, programmers can perform MapReduce tasks easily without having to type complex codes in Java.
c)The code size decereases considerably.
d)80 line mapreduce code can be reduced to 5 lines,reduction is in 1/20 ratio.

Q.7. Is Pig latin commands case sensitive?
Ans)It is partially case sensitive.For example in dump,describe like commands pig latin is not case sensitive.
Whereas there are some commands which are case sensitive.

Q.8.What is a data flow language? 
Ans)
In a dataflow language, you have a stream of data which is passed from instruction to instruction to be processed.
Conditional execution, jumps and procedure calls route the data to different instructions.
